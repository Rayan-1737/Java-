/// A for-each loop in Java is used to iterate over arrays or collections without using an index. 
/// Itâ€™s simple and easy to read.
/// How it works:
/// The loop automatically picks each element from numbers one by one.
/// No need to use an index (i) like in a normal for loop.
/// It's best for reading data, but not for modifying elements.
